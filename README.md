# NLX System Resources

<img src="Pics/front_diag.jpg">

By chance, I obtained an entire NLX form factor system from eBay. It consists of an Asus SP98-N motherboard and an ElanVital Aegis B5-N PC case.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NLX_(motherboard_form_factor), it's an old and obscure form factor that never gained much popularity back in the 90s. I was fascinated by this compact-sized system and spent a lot of time on learning what it can do, and created many stuff to enhance it for "playability" in these modern days.
